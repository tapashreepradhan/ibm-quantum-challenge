Quantum challenge hosted by IBM

## Lab 1
### Intro to Dynamic Circuits
This lab consists of simple exercises where you will create small circuits to understand what dynamic circuits are and how they work. There will be also exercises about dynamic circuit gates that simulate the classical if statement. Finally we’ll introduce you to the "repeat until success" method.

## Lab 2
### Quantum Teleportation
In this lab we’ll be sending a quantum message from one person to another. The only issue? Once a superposition is observed, the message is destroyed. This lab walks through the theory behind that problem, and the clever solution called Teleportation.

## Lab 3
### Iterative Phase Estimation
Iterative Phase Estimation (IPE) is a variant of the phase estimation algorithm which requires the use of only one auxiliary qubit. Because it requires mid-circuit measurements and classical feedforward operations, IPE could not be executed on IBM Quantum hardware before the introduction of dynamic circuits. In this lab, we will use the newly introduced dynamic circuits capabilities to implement IPE.
